Cisdem AppCrypt is a dedicated security utility designed to provide robust protection for your computer usage. It serves as a powerful application lock and web content filter, empowering you to control which programs and sites can be accessed on your system.

This utility is invaluable for maintaining focus in professional environments, enforcing parental controls at home, and ensuring overall privacy. The setup process is straightforward, allowing you to quickly add applications to a block list and define websites by keywords or full URLs. Once activated, Cisdem AppCrypt runs efficiently in the background, requiring the password to launch any protected app or to bypass a blocked site. It supports modern versions of macOS and integrates smoothly with the system, offering a reliable and user-friendly approach to digital security management without compromising system performance.
